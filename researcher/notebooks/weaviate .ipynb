Credit cards can make it seem easy to buy expensive \\nthings when you don’t have the cash in your pocket—or in the \\nbank.

If you owe money on your credit cards, the wisest thing \\nyou can do is pay off the balance in full as quickly as possible.

Every time you use a credit card, write down how much \\nyou have spent and figure out how much you’ll have to pay that \\nmonth. If you know you won’t be able to pay your balance in \\nfull, try to figure out how much you can pay each month and \\nhow long it’ll take to pay the balance in full.\\nPay Off the Card with the Highest Rate\\n If you’ve got unpaid balances on several credit cards, you should \\nfirst pay down the card that charges the highest rate. Pay as much \\nas you can toward that debt each month until your balance is once \\nagain zero, while still paying the minimum on your other cards.\\nThe same advice goes for any other high interest debt (about 8% or \\nabove) which does not offer the tax advantages of, for example, a mortgage.\\nNow, once you have paid off those credit cards and begun to \\nset aside some money to save and invest, what are your choices?\\n', metadata={'source': 'sec-guide-to-savings-and-investing.pdf', 'file_path': 'sec-guide-to-savings-and-investing.pdf', 'page': 10, 'total_pages': 32, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'SEC Saving and Investing ', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CC 2017 (Macintosh)', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20170703135544-04'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20170719104906-04'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

Sav-\\nings products include savings accounts, checking accounts, and \\ncertificates of deposit. Some deposits in these products may be \\ninsured by the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation or the \\nNational Credit Union Administration.

What if you save a dollar when it can \\nbuy a loaf of bread. But years later when you withdraw that \\ndollar plus the interest you earned on it, it can only buy half \\na loaf? This is why many people put some of their money in \\nsavings, but look to investing so they can earn more over long \\nperiods of time, say three years or longer. \\nInvesting\\nWhen you “invest,” you have a greater chance of losing your \\nmoney than when you “save.” The money you invest in se-\\ncurities, mutual funds, and other similar investments typically \\nis not federally insured.

If talking to the in-\\nvestment professional doesn’t resolve the problem, talk to the \\nfirm’s manager, and write a letter to confirm your conversa-\\ntion. If that doesn’t lead to a resolution, you may have to initi-\\nate private legal action. You may need to take action quickly \\nbecause legal time limits for doing so vary. Your local bar as-\\nsociation can provide referrals for attorneys who specialize in \\nsecurities law. \\nAt the same time, call or write to us and let us know what \\nthe problem was. Investor complaints are very important to the \\nSEC. You may think you’re the only one experiencing a prob-\\nlem, but typically, you’re not alone. Sometimes it takes only one \\ninvestor’s complaint to trigger an investigation that exposes a \\nbad broker or an illegal scheme. Complaints can be filed online \\nwith us by going to www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml.\\n', metadata={'source': 'sec-guide-to-savings-and-investing.pdf', 'file_path': 'sec-guide-to-savings-and-investing.pdf', 'page': 28, 'total_pages': 32, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'SEC Saving and Investing ', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CC 2017 (Macintosh)', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20170703135544-04'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20170719104906-04'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",
