       "\"Based on the provided information, the drama at OpenAI was prompted by the abrupt firing of CEO Sam Altman and subsequent board upheaval. The upheaval reflected underlying tensions within the company, stemming from its unconventional structure as a nonprofit research lab with a focus on AI tools that benefit humanity. The drama culminated in Altman's reinstatement and the formation of a new board of directors to navigate the company's future. The chaotic events at OpenAI prompted discussions on board governance, ethical leadership, and the role of AI in innovation. The new board is expected to reassess OpenAI's structure and address friction resulting from its hybrid model. The resolution of the drama remains a pivotal moment in the ongoing dialogue about responsible innovation and the expanding role of AI in shaping technology's future.\\n\\nSources:\\n- Forbes: [The OpenAI Drama: Sam Altman And The Struggle For AI’s Future](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/11/19/the-openai-drama-sam-altman-and-the-struggle-for-ais-future/)\\n- KQED: [How OpenAI's Origins Explain the Sam Altman Drama](https://www.kqed.org/news/11968285/how-openais-origins-explain-the-sam-altman-drama)\\n- NPR: [How OpenAI's origins explain the Sam Altman drama](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/24/1215015362/chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-fired-explained)\\n- Nature: [What the OpenAI drama means for AI progress — and safety](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03700-4)\""

The sequence of events can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n- **Friday**: Altman\\'s Departure\\n  - Altman was abruptly fired during a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\\'s board, convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever.\\n  - The board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board.\\n- **Saturday**: Whispers of Reconciliation\\n  - An anonymous letter written by former OpenAI employees during the Altman drama called on the board to examine whether Altman was putting commercial products and fundraising goals before the nonprofit\\'s founding mission.\\n- **Sunday Afternoon**: The Challenge of Absolution and Legal Implications\\n- **Sunday Night**: The Board Resigns\\n  - Altman\\'s firing came as a complete surprise, adding a layer of astonishment to the unfolding narrative.\\n- **Monday Morning**: New Beginnings\\n  - Altman and Brockman announced a new initiative with Microsoft that would continue OpenAI\\'s original mission in the tech industry.\\n\\n## Employee Response and Board Reshuffle\\n\\nThe drama at OpenAI reached a critical juncture when 702 out of OpenAI\\'s 770 employees committed to leaving the company unless Altman was restored. The employees also demanded the assembly of a new board. This unprecedented show of solidarity from the majority of the workforce led to a significant shift in the organization\\'s leadership.\\n\\nThe board initially refused to entertain the possibility of Altman\\'s return. However, the overwhelming support from the employees prompted a reshuffle, resulting in the restoration of Altman as CEO and the formation of a new, temporary board. Notably, only one former board member, Adam D\\'Angelo, the CEO of Quora, remained on the new board.\\n\\n## Root Causes of the Drama\\n\\nThe conflict at OpenAI can be traced back to the unusual way the company was structured. Founded in 2015 as a non-profit research lab by Altman, Elon Musk, and others, OpenAI prioritized principles over profit. However, tensions had long simmered under the surface of the company, culminating in the recent upheaval.\\n\\nOne of the key issues that divided the company was Altman\\'s drive to transition OpenAI from a nonprofit organization into a successful business. This clashed with board member concerns over the safety of AI tools and the organization\\'s mission to develop AI tools that would \"benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.\"\\n\\n## Industry Response and Implications\\n\\nThe OpenAI drama has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, prompting discussions about responsible innovation, ethical decision-making, and the expanding role of AI in shaping the technological future. The investigative reporting by prominent figures in the industry has shed light on the intricate dynamics of board governance, external influences, and the pursuit of AI advancement.\\n\\nThe events at OpenAI serve as a compelling narrative, highlighting the complexities of balancing commercial interests with ethical leadership and transparency in the development of AI technologies. The resolution of the drama and the subsequent industry response have significant implications for the future of AI development and governance.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe OpenAI drama, characterized by the sudden firing and subsequent restoration of CEO Sam Altman, has brought to the forefront critical questions about the governance of AI organizations, the balance between commercial interests and ethical considerations, and the impact of internal dynamics on the pursuit of innovation.

       "  'raw_content': 'Contents\\nTaylor Swift\\nTaylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her songwriting, artistry, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry and popular culture, and her life is a subject of widespread media coverage.\\nSwift began professional songwriting at age 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with Taylor Swift (2006). Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift\\'s first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". She departed from her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\\nSwift signed with Republic Records in 2018. She released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020), embraced indie folk and alternative rock on 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, explored understated pop styles on Midnights (2022), and released four re-recorded albums subtitled Taylor\\'s Version after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs \"Cruel Summer\", \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"All Too Well\", and \"Is It Over Now?\". The Eras Tour, her 2023–2024 concert tour, and its accompanying concert film both became the highest-grossing ever in their respective fields. Swift directed music videos and films such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).\\nOne of the world\\'s best-selling musicians with 200\\xa0million records sold, Swift has earned 117 Guinness World Records and received the Global Recording Artist of the Year award three times from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift has appeared on lists such as Rolling Stone\\'s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard\\'s Greatest of All Time Artists, and the World\\'s 100 Most Powerful Women by Forbes. Her accolades include 12 Grammy Awards (including three Album of the Year wins), 1 Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards (including Artist of the Decade – 2010s), 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards. Swift is a philanthropist and an advocate for artists\\' rights and women\\'s empowerment.\\nLife and career\\nEarly life\\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[4] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), is a former homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5] Taylor has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift,[6] and is of Scottish,[7] German, and Italian descent.[8][9] Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was an opera singer.[10]\\nSwift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[11][12] She is a Christian.[13] She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, run by Bernadine Franciscan sisters,[14] before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[15] The family moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[16] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[17] She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.[18][19]\\nAt age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[20] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[21] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain\\'s songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\".[22] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[23][24] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[25] She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[26] She was rejected, however, because \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\"[27]\\nWhen Swift was around 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write \"Lucky You\".[28] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York–based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels.[29] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[30][31][32] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch\\'s Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[11][33] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[34] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[35][36]\\n2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album\\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[37][38] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[39] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[40] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I\\'ve ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She\\'d write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she\\'d come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[41] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label\\'s lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people\\'s stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[32][24] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[42]\\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville\\'s Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[44] She was one of Big Machine\\'s first signings,[32] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[45][46] She began working on her eponymous debut album with producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right \"chemistry\".[24] Swift wrote three of the album\\'s songs alone and co-wrote the remaining eight with Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[47] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[48] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her \"honesty, intelligence and idealism\".[49] The album peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[50] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.[51]\\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[52] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[53] as a replacement for Eric Church.[54] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[52][11]\\nFollowing \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\". All appeared on Billboard\\'s Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\" reaching number one. With \"Our Song\", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[55] \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" reached number thirteen on the US Billboard Hot 100.[56] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[57][58] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians\\' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[59] Brad Paisley,[60] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[61]\\nSwift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association\\'s Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person to be honored with the title.[62] She also won the Country Music Association\\'s Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[63] the Academy of Country Music Awards\\' Top New Female Vocalist,[64] and the American Music Awards\\' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[65] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[66] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again,[67] and dated singer Joe Jonas briefly.[68][69]\\n2008–2010: Fearless\\nSwift\\'s second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008, in North America,[72] and in March 2009 in other markets.[73] Critics lauded Swift\\'s honest and vulnerable songwriting in contrast to other teenage singers.[74] Five singles were released in 2008–2009: \"Love Story\", \"White Horse\", \"You Belong with Me\", \"Fifteen\", and \"Fearless\".

West claimed he had received her approval for the line, and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the single amicably over the phone; a full recording of the call leaked in 2020 established that West did not disclose that he would call her a bitch.[173][174]\\nAfter briefly dating English actor Tom Hiddleston,[175] Swift entered a six-year relationship with English actor Joe Alwyn in September 2016.[176][177][178] She wrote the song \"Better Man\" for country band Little Big Town,[note 3] which earned her the Song of the Year award at the 51st CMA Awards.[180] Swift and English singer Zayn Malik released the joint single \"I Don\\'t Wanna Live Forever\" for Fifty Shades Darker: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (2017).

In November 2018, she signed a new deal with the Universal Music Group; her subsequent releases were promoted by Republic Records. Swift said the contract included a provision for her to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[200] Vox called it a huge commitment from Universal, which was \"far from assured\" until Swift intervened.[201]\\nSwift released her seventh studio album, Lover, on August 23, 2019.[202] Besides Jack Antonoff, Swift worked with new producers Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[203] Lover made Swift the first female artist to have a sixth consecutive album sell more than 500,000 copies in one week in the US.[204] Critics commended the album\\'s free-spirited mood and emotional intimacy.[205][206] The lead single, \"Me!\", peaked at number two on the Hot 100.[207] Other singles from Lover were the US top 10 singles \"You Need to Calm Down\" and \"Lover\", top 40 single \"The Man\",[56] and \"Cruel Summer\", which became a resurgent success in 2023 and reached number one on the Hot 100.[208] Lover was the world\\'s best-selling album by a solo artist of 2019, selling 3.2\\xa0million copies,[209] and along with its singles earned nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[210] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, \"Me!\" won Best Visual Effects, and \"You Need to Calm Down\" won Video of the Year and Video for Good. Swift was the first female and second artist overall to win Video of the Year for a video that they directed.[211]\\nWhile promoting Lover, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and Big Machine over the purchase of the masters of her back catalog.[212] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign.[212][213] Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020.[214] Besides music, she played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber\\'s musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song \"Beautiful Ghosts\".[215][216] Critics panned the film but praised Swift\\'s performance.[217] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift\\'s life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and was released on Netflix that January.[218][219] Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group in February 2020 after her 16-year-old contract with Sony/ATV expired.[220]\\nAmidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift released two surprise albums: Folklore on July 24, and Evermore on December 11, 2020.[221][222] Both explore indie folk and alternative rock with a more muted production compared to her previous upbeat pop songs.[223][224] Swift wrote and recorded the albums with Jack Antonoff, and Aaron Dessner from The National, as producers.[225] Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced select songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[226] The albums garnered widespread critical acclaim.

Both releases peaked atop the Billboard 200,[235] becoming the first ever re-recorded albums to do so.[236] Fearless (Taylor\\'s Version) was preceded by \"Love Story (Taylor\\'s Version)\", which made her the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on the Hot Country Songs chart.[237] Red (Taylor\\'s Version) was supported by \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100.[238] The song was accompanied by a short film, which won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video[239] and Swift\\'s record third MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year.[240]\\nSwift\\'s tenth studio album, Midnights, was released on October 21, 2022.[241] Characterized by an understated electropop[242][243] and synth-pop[244] sound, the album was dubbed by Rolling Stone critics as an instant classic.[245][246] The album was her fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies and broke various sales and streaming records,[247] including the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify.[248] Its tracks, led by single \"Anti-Hero\", monopolized the top 10 of the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist to do so.[249] Two other singles, \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\", peaked at number two on the Hot 100.[250] Swift won nine awards at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year (\"Anti-Hero\") for a record fourth time,[251] and received six nominations at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, including a record seventh for Song of the Year (\"Anti-Hero\").[127]\\nIn March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her 10 studio albums.

Speak Now (Taylor\\'s Version), released on July 7, 2023, made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand.[257] 1989 (Taylor\\'s Version), released on October 27, 2023, became Swift\\'s record-extending sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US.[258] and the best-selling album of 2023. It surpassed Midnights for her career\\'s largest album sales week.[258] Its single \"Is It Over Now?\" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, replacing her own \"Cruel Summer\".[259] Swift\\'s music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity post-pandemic.[260] Music Business Worldwide remarked that she entered a \"new stratosphere of global career success\" in 2023.[261] Swift was the most streamed artist of 2023 on Spotify,[262] Apple Music,[263] and Amazon Music,[264] the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023),[265] and the first living artist to simultaneously chart five albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200.[266]\\nBeyond her albums, Swift featured on five songs from 2021 to 2023: \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" by Big Red Machine,[267] a remix of \"Gasoline\" by Haim,[268] \"The Joker and the Queen\" by Ed Sheeran,[269] and \"The Alcott\" by the National.[270] For the soundtrack of the 2022 film Where the Crawdads Sing, she recorded \"Carolina\", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[271] Outside of music, Swift had a supporting role in the 2022 period comedy film Amsterdam and has signed to direct an upcoming feature film for Searchlight Pictures.[272][273] She began dating American football player Travis Kelce in 2023.[274]\\nArtistry\\nInfluences\\nOne of Swift\\'s earliest memories of music is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church.[5] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own.\"[275] Swift said she owes her confidence and \"fascination with writing and storytelling\" to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[276][277]\\nSwift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[278] introduced to the genre by female country artists of the 1990s: Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[279][280] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[281] Hill was Swift\\'s childhood role model, as she would often imitate her.[282] She admired the Chicks\\' defiant attitude and ability to play their own instruments,[283] and was also influenced by older country stars like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton,[23] the last of whom she believes is exemplary to female songwriters.[113] As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell\\'s emotional and autobiographical lyrics, highlighting Mitchell\\'s album Blue as a favorite \"because it explores somebody\\'s soul so deeply\".[284] She also spoke of influence from 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette,[285][286] and alt-country artists like Patty Griffin[287] and Lori McKenna.[288]\\nVarious pop and rock artists have also influenced Swift. She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models.[11][289] 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[290][291] She also cited Keith Urban\\'s musical style and Fall Out Boy\\'s lyrics as major influences.[292][293]\\nGenres\\n\"If there\\'s one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it\\'s that she refuses to be put in a box. Her ever-evolving sound took her from country darling to pop phenom to folk\\'s newest raconteur.\"\\n—The Recording Academy, 2021[294]\\nSwift is known for venturing into various music genres and undergoing artistic reinventions,[295][273] having been described as a \"music chameleon\".[296][297] She self-identified as a country musician until 2012, when she released her fourth studio album, Red.[298] Her albums were promoted to country radio, but music critics noted wide-ranging styles of pop and rock.[299][300] After 2010, they observed that Swift\\'s melodies are rooted in pop music, and the country music elements are limited to instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and fiddle, and her slight twang;[301][302] some commented that her country music identity was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical style.[303][304] Although the Nashville music industry was receptive of Swift\\'s status as a country musician, critics accused her of abandoning her roots in favor of crossover success in the mainstream pop market.[305][306] Red\\'s eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles intensified the critical debate, to which Swift responded, \"I leave the genre labeling to other people.\"[307]\\nMusic journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her musical career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[308] She abandoned her country music identity in 2014 with the release of her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989. Swift described it as her first \"documented, official pop album\".[309] Her subsequent albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements.[310][311][312] Midnights (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, \"subdued and amorphous pop sound\".[313][314] Although reviews of Swift\\'s pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift\\'s pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background—a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[315][316] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift\\'s pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.[317] Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, folk and indie rock styles with her 2020 studio albums Folklore and Evermore.[318][319] Clash said her career \"has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing\", reaching a point at which \"Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift\", not defined by any genre.[320]\\nVoice\\nSwift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range,[323] and a generally soft but versatile timbre.[324][325] As a country singer, her vocals were criticized by some as weak and strained compared to those of her contemporaries.[326] Swift admitted her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career and has worked hard to improve.[327] Reviews of her vocals remained mixed after she transitioned to pop music with 1989; critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing \"intimacy over power and nuance\".[328] They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.[329]\\nThe Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift\\'s defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[330] With Reputation, critics noted she was \"learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own\",[331] swapping her \"signature\" expressive vocals for \"cool, conversational, detached\" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles.[332][333][334] Alternative Press stated that her \"evocative\" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[335]\\nReviews of Swift\\'s later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[302][336][337] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[338][339][340] Pitchfork described it as \"versatile and expressive\".[341] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and \"fuller\" tone of her voice.[342][343][344] An i review said Swift\\'s voice is \"leagues better now\" with her newfound vocal furniture.[345] The Guardian highlighted \"yo-yoing vocal yelps\" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift\\'s voice,[346] and that her country twang faded away.[347] Midnights received acclaim for Swift\\'s nuanced vocal delivery.[348] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[325] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift\\'s live vocals.[349] Musicologist Alyssa Barna said that Swift\\'s timbre is \"breathy and bright\" in her upper register and \"full and dark\" in the lower.[224]\\nSongwriting\\nSwift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications.[350][351][352] English-language scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and verbal writing style are rare amongst her peers.[353][354] Swift\\'s bridges are often underscored as one of the best aspects of her songs,[355][356] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[357] Mojo described her as \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[358]\\nIn The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[11] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[359][360] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[361][362] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[363][364] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[365] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[290] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift\\'s fame,[366] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[367] Other themes in Swift\\'s music include family dynamics, friendship,[368][369] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[277][370]\\nHer confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[371][11][372] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[373][374][375] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[376][377] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[333] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[377] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[11] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[378][379][380] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[381]\\nOn her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[382] Without referencing her personal life, she imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[361] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[382] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[383] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[356]\\nSwift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", referring to songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[384] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most \"emotionally vulnerable\" song of the album.[385] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers\\' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\" than Swift.[386] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[387] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[249] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You\\'re Anything Like Me\".[388]\\nPerformances\\nJournalists have described Swift as one of the all-time great live performers. Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[389][390][391][392][393] Swift is known for her ability to command large audiences, such as in a stadium,[394][395][396] without having to rely fully on dance like her contemporaries do.[397] According to V magazine\\'s Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[398]\\nIn a 2008 review of Swift\\'s early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd\\'s energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[399] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[400] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[401]\\nCritics have highlighted Swift\\'s versatility as an entertainer, praising her ability to switch onstage personas and performance styles depending on the varying themes and aesthetics of her albums.[402][403] Her concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[404] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[405] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[406] acoustic guitar; piano;[407] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[408][409] banjo,[410] or ukulele.[411] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[349][412] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[413][407] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop\\'s most approachable superstar\",[414] and the 21st century\\'s most popular performer.[415]\\nVideo and film\\nSwift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music making process.[416] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011[417] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White the year before.[418] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn\\'t in the scenes.\"[419]\\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift\\'s involvement in the craft.[420] She worked with American Express for the \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed), and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[421] Swift produced the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[422]\\nHer production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[423] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles \"Me!\" with Dave Meyers, and \"You Need to Calm Down\" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and \"Lover\" with Drew Kirsch,[424] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for \"The Man\" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[425] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[249] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[426] Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as her filmmaking influences.[416]\\nAchievements\\nSwift\\'s discography is a \"critically hailed songbook\", as per Time\\'s Sam Lansky.[427] She has won 12 Grammy Awards (including three for Album of the Year—tying for the most by an artist),[428] an Emmy Award,[429] 40 American Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[430] 39 Billboard Music Awards (the most won by an artist—tying with Drake),[431] 117 Guinness World Records,[432] 23 MTV Video Music Awards (including four Video of the

of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time in 2015.[436][437] At the 64th BMI Awards in 2016, Swift was the first woman to be honored with an award named after its recipient.[438]\\nCommercially, from available data, Swift has amassed over 50\\xa0million album sales and 150\\xa0million single sales as of 2019,[439][440][441] and 114\\xa0million units globally, including 78\\xa0billion streams as of 2021.[442][443] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) ranked her as the Global Recording Artist of the Year for a record three times (2014, 2019 and 2022).[444] Swift has the most number-one albums in the United Kingdom and Ireland for a female artist this millennium,[445][446] earned the highest income for an artist on Chinese digital music platforms

Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019.[471] She was one of the \"Silence Breakers\" that the magazine spotlighted as Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault,[472] and received the honor again in 2023 for her cultural domination that year.[427] Time described Swift as the first Person of the Year to be recognized for \"achievement in the arts\", as well as the first woman to be recognized and appear on a Person of the Year cover more than once.[473][474] In 2014, she was named to Forbes\\' 30 Under 30 list in the music category[475] and again in 2017 in its \"All-Star Alumni\" category.[476] Swift became the youngest woman to be included on Forbes\\' list of the 100 most powerful women in 2015, ranked at number 64.[477] In 2023, she was ranked by Forbes as the fifth-most powerful woman in the world, the first entertainer to ever place in the top five.[478][479] Swift received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.[249]\\nCultural status\\nSwift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture and the economy.[480][481] She dominates cultural conversations,[482][483] which has led publications to describe her as a cultural \"vitality\" or zeitgeist.[484][485][486] Her music, life and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[295] Initially a teen idol,[487] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[310][488] publications describe her immense popularity and longevity as a kind of fame unwitnessed since the 20th century.[489][490] In 2013, New York magazine\\'s Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the \"world\\'s biggest pop star\" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[308] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[491]\\nHer fans are known as Swifties.[253] Billboard noted only few artists have had her chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[492] Swift\\'s million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[493][494] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\".[495]\\nAlthough labeled by the media in her early career as \"America\\'s Sweetheart\" for her girl next door persona,[496][497] Swift has been accused by detractors of being \"calculated\" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[173][174] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and \"slut-shaming\",[498][499] as well as a topic of rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[500] She has been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[501][502]\\nLegacy\\n\"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we\\'re at this moment where there\\'s no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that\\'s on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact.\"\\n– Jason Lipshutz, Billboard executive director, 2023[503]\\nSwift helped shape the modern country music scene,[504] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[308][504] pioneered the use of internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[32][52] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[505][308] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[506] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\", a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[507][508]\\nAccording to publications, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[509] and her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[510] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[511] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift in the 21st century.[353][512] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album \"eras\".[513][514] Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research.[295] Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural and sociopolitical

the torch forward\".[529] Springsteen called her a \"tremendous\" writer,[530] while Ringo Starr and Billy Joel considered Swift the Beatles\\' successor.[531][532] Britney Spears labeled Swift \"the most iconic pop woman of our generation\".[533]\\nEntrepreneurship\\nMedia outlets describe Swift as a savvy businesswoman.[534][535] She is also known for her traditional album rollouts, consisting

because of Swift.[538] Publications describe her discography as a music \"universe\" subject to analyses by fans, critics and journalists.[539][540][541] Swift maintains an active presence on social

WorldPride NYC 2019 at the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights monument, and has donated to the LGBT organizations Tennessee Equality Project and GLAAD.[562][563][564]\\nA supporter of the March for Our Lives

The pop star and Time’s 2023 Person of the Year released Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Extended Version) for streaming on December 13—her birthday. The movie is available for rent on major streaming platforms, including Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+. It includes performances of three songs—“Long Live,” “The Archer,” and “Wildest Dreams”—that didn’t make the theatrical cut.\\nOn Monday, the 12-time Grammy winner notched her first Golden Globe Award nomination for the movie, which smashed the record for highest-grossing concert film of all time. The Eras Tour is competing in the new Cinematic and Box Office Achievement category alongside some of this year’s biggest blockbusters including Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. The award recognizes excellence among movies that earned at least $150 million, including $100 million domestically. The 2024 Golden Globes are on January 7.\\nRent Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Extended Version) on Amazon Prime Video or Apple TV+.\\nSwift’s ongoing Eras Tour, which restarts in February for its mostly international leg, has already earned more than $1 billion, according to the concert trade publication Pollstar. She is the first musician to ever accomplish this feat, topping Elton John’s previous record for his Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour.\\nJump to:\\nWho Is Taylor Swift?\\nMusician Taylor Swift began earning renown as a country singer by age 16. Early hits like “Love Story” and “You Belong With Me” appealed to country and pop fans alike and helped fuel the multiplatinum success of her albums, including the award-winning Fearless. Now a pop megastar with 12 Grammys to her name, the “Shake It Off” and “Anti-Hero” singer released her latest studio album, Midnights, one year ago and shared her rerecorded 1989 (Taylor’s Version) album this October. Named Time’s 2023 Person of the Year, Swift is currently performing on her record-breaking Eras Tour and is dating professional football player Travis Kelce.\\nQuick Facts\\nFULL NAME: Taylor Alison SwiftBORN: December 13, 1989BIRTHPLACE: Reading, PennsylvaniaASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius\\nWhere Is Taylor Swift From?\\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. Swift spent her early years with her parents, Scott and Andrea, and brother, Austin, on the family’s Christmas tree farm in nearby Wyomissing. “I had the most magical childhood, running free and going anywhere I wanted to in my head,” she told Rolling Stone. She learned to ride horses and even competed for a time, but a greater passion soon took root.\\nSwift followed in the musical footsteps of her grandmother Marjorie Finlay, who was a professional opera singer. By age 10, Swift was singing at a variety of local events, including fairs and contests. She sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” at a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game at age 11 and began writing her own songs and learning guitar at 12 years old. Her early music idols included Shania Twain and The Chicks.\\nTo pursue her music career, Swift often visited Nashville, Tennessee, the country music capital. There, she cowrote songs and tried to land a recording contract. Noting her dedication, her family moved to nearby Hendersonville when she was 13 in an attempt to further young Swift’s career. She attended Hendersonville High School before finishing out her education through the home schooling program of Aaron Academy, a private Christian school, once her musical career took off.\\nMusic Career\\nOne of today’s biggest pop stars, Swift has worked her way from performing at local venues in Tennessee to commanding stadiums full of Swifties—her adoring fans—on international tours. A stellar performance at The Bluebird Café in Nashville helped her get a contract with Scott Borchetta’s Big Machine Records at age 14.\\nShe spent her early career as a country musician, and her first single, “Tim McGraw,” was named after one of the genre’s biggest stars. The 2006 song, which she wrote in her freshman year math class, became a Top 10 hit on Billboard’s country chart, quickly launching Swift into the spotlight. McGraw and fellow country music singer Faith Hill even brought Swift on their Soul2Soul tour the next year as an opening act. Reminiscing on the tour years later, McGraw told ET Canada, “Faith and I both knew that there was no stopping her. She’s a special talent.”\\nIt wasn’t long before Swift began receiving critical praise for her work. The teenager won the Horizon Award from the Country Music Association (CMA) and the Academy of Country Music (ACM) Award for Top New Female Vocalist in 2007. The next year, she was nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammys. She became the youngest artist to win the Grammy for Album of the Year, for Fearless in 2010.\\nThe country music darling eventually began experimenting with genre. With her fifth album, 1989, she decisively reintroduced herself as a pop musician. Her new sound excited fans, and the 2014 release is one of her most successful to date, spending 11 weeks atop the Billboard 200 and selling more than 1.2 million copies in its first week.\\nNot everything about her music changed, though. Personal experiences, including her romantic relationships, continue to fuel Swift’s songwriting. “I’m enthralled by relationships, and I love the drama in them, but that’s usually where it lives,” Swift told Rolling Stone in 2009, maintaining “I’m not a dramatic person.” Hardly the first musician to utilize this practice, the pop star usually doesn’t reveal who her song subjects are, unless they are family or friends. Instead, her loyal fans obsess over easter eggs in her lyrics and music videos to pinpoint a likely person.\\nSince March 2023, Swift has been performing on her headline-grabbing Eras Tour. It marks her sixth international tour, having first headlined her own concert series after the release of her award-winning sophomore album, Fearless. When presale tickets for the Eras Tour went live in November 2022, so many fans attempted to snag their seats that Ticketmaster canceled the general sale, leading to a congressional hearing about the debacle. Already one of the highest-grossing touring musicians as of July 2022, Swift has earned more than $1 billion on the Eras Tour so far—surpassing Elton John’s record-setting farewell tour that spanned five years. The Eras Tour wraps in December 2024 after dozens more concerts, mostly abroad.\\nSwift’s successes in 2023 also include the release of the 1989 (Taylor’s Version) album and the record-setting concert film Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, two more No. 1 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, tying with Drake as the artist with the most Billboard Music Awards in history, dethroning Bad Bunny as Spotify’s most streamed artist of the year, and achieving billionaire status. All that culminated in Time naming her its 2023 Person of the Year. Swift is the fifth woman to receive the honor.\\nHow Many Grammys Does Taylor Swift Have?\\nSwift has won 12 Grammy Awards out of 52 nominations, including six nominations for the upcoming 2024 awards show.\\nShe was first nominated in 2008 for Best New Artist. Although Amy Winehouse claimed the honor, 20-year-old Swift lived up to her promising career start by collecting four Grammys the next year. Fearless won Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and “White Horse” was named Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 2009.\\nSwift has now won Album of the Year three times: for Fearless, 1989, and folklore. She is the only woman to accomplish this feat for solo recordings. Even so, Swift has never won the top song honor of Song of the Year, though she has received a record seven nominations in the category. As for Best Country Song, the artist has won twice in five nominations; “Mean” earned the trophy the year after “White Horse” did.\\nIn 2024, the pop star could become the first artist to win Album of the Year four times with Midnights, which is also competing for Best Pop Vocal Album. Her other 2024 Grammy nominations include: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance for “Anti-Hero,” as well as Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for “Karma” featuring Ice Spice.\\nThe singer-songwriter has won a host of other accolades, including nine CMA Awards and eight ACM Awards. Both country music organizations have twice named her Entertainer of the Year. Since her first in 2009, Swift has taken home 23 Video Music Awards, second only to Beyoncé. Billboard named her Woman of the Year in 2012, one of Swift’s 29 awards from the publication.\\nIn December 2023, Swift notched another first when she received her first Golden Globe Award nomination for Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. Her concert film is competing in the Cinematic and Box Office Achievement category at the January 2024 awards ceremony.\\nHit Songs\\nEver since her first single, “Tim McGraw,” in 2006, Swift’s music has found a home on the Billboard charts. As of December 13, 2023, she has had 232 songs grace the mainstream Hot 100. That includes 11 No. 1 hits and a record-setting 49 songs in the top 10; no woman has had more top 10 hits, and Swift only trails Drake among all artists. She also holds nine No. 1 Hot Country Songs, including “Our Song” and “Should’ve Said No.”\\n“Fearless” debuted at No. 9 on the mainstream chart in November 2008, marking Swift’s first top 10 song. Her first chart-topper was roughly four years away. That came in September 2012 with Grammy-nominated “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” Her other No 1. songs include:\\nAt 10 minutes, 13 seconds, “All Too Well (Taylor’s Version)” is the longest No. 1 hit in history. “Shake It Off” is Swift’s only diamond-certified song, having sold the equivalent of 10 million copies.\\nAlbums\\nTo date, Swift has released 18 albums, including 10 original studio albums, four rereleases, and four live albums. Excluding those live recordings, every album since her sophomore effort, Fearless, has nabbed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 for at least one week. In December 2023, she became the first living artist to have five albums rank among the chart’s top 10 simultaneously.\\nHer first album came in 2006 with Taylor Swift, and her most recent all-new music is on 2022’s Midnights. Her latest rerecorded album, 1989 (Taylor’s Version), debuted in October 2023.\\nHer albums, in order, are:\\nTaylor Swift\\nTaylor Swift\\nThe young musician’s self-titled debut album was released in October 2006 when she was 16. Spurred on by the success of songs like “Tim McGraw,” “Teardrops on My Guitar,” and “Our Song,” it became a No. 1 country album in August 2007 and held the top spot for a total of 24 weeks. Indicating her future crossover success, the album also reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200. Taylor Swift has sold more than 7 million copies to date.\\nFearless\\nFearless\\nIn November 2008, Swift released her next album, Fearless, which quickly hit the top of both the country and pop charts, marking her first No. 1 mainstream album. It maintained its apex ranking on the charts for weeks on end. By the end of the year, Swift had become 2008’s highest-selling country artist.\\nNow a Diamond-certified album, Fearless earned Swift her first Grammy Awards in January 2010. In addition to Best Country Album, it took home one of the night’s top honors with Album of the Year. The track “White Horse” won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance, while “You Belong With Me” was nominated for three Grammys. Also named Album of the Year at the CMA and ACM Awards, Fearless featured the top 10 hits “Love Story,” “Fearless,” and “Change.”\\nSpeak Now\\nSpeak Now\\nAfter skeptics doubted her involvement in her songwriting, Swift chose to write her next album alone. Speak Now came out in October 2010 and immediately found success. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and sold more than 1 million copies in its first week. Popular tracks included “Mine,” “Back To December,” “Speak Now,” and the Grammy-winning “Mean.” Swift was once again nominated for Best Country Album at the Grammys but didn’t win.\\nRed\\nRed\\nEdging her way into pop music, Swift followed with Red, which featured her first No. 1 single “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” and also topped 1 million in its first week of sales. The October 2012 release collected Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Best Country Album. “I Knew You Were Trouble,” “Red,” and “Begin Again” were among its most popular songs.\\n1989\\n1989\\nWith her next effort, Swift stepped outside her country music roots squarely into mainstream pop. She released 1989 in October 2014. It tied her record (set by Fearless) for most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, produced three chart-topping singles, and moved more than 1.2 million copies in its first week. That made Swift the first artist to pass the 1 million mark in opening-week sales for three albums. She won her second Album of the Year award at the Grammys in February 2016 as well as Best Pop Vocal Album for her work.\\nreputation\\nreputation\\nIn late August 2017, using an image of a snake, Swift revealed that she would release her sixth studio album, reputation, that November.\\xa0Swift debuted the first single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” on August 24. In the music video, Swift played characters of all her misrepresentations. The video had more than 19 million views on YouTube within the first day.\\nDays before reputation’s scheduled November 10 release, its secret tracklist was leaked to social media. Swift responded by posting the complete list to her Instagram page: 15 songs, including a collaborative effort with Ed Sheeran and rapper Future titled “End Game.” The two later appeared in the video for the track, which debuted in January 2018.\\nReputation sold 1.05 million copies in the United States over its first four days. Along with giving the artist her fourth consecutive album to surpass 1 million in sales for its opening week, that total made reputation the top-selling album of 2017. Its success continued into 2018, surpassing 2 million in sales while generating the release of seven singles. By the end of the year, Grammy-nominated reputation had been honored with Favorite Pop/Rock Album at the American Music Awards and Top Selling Album at the Billboard Music Awards.\\nLover\\nLover\\nOn April 26, 2019, Swift debuted “ME!” with Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco, along with a video of the duo singing and dancing amid a panoply of elaborate sets and swirling colors. It became the first single from her seventh studio album, Lover, with “You Need to Calm Down” and the title track also hitting the airwaves as singles over the next few months. The album was released in August.\\nIn November, Swift claimed a whopping six wins at the American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Artist of the Decade honors. Swift also received her third consecutive Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album. A few weeks later, it was reported that Lover was the only album to sell 1 million copies in the U.S. in 2019.\\nNearly four years later, Lover’s “Cruel Summer” was promoted as her latest single amid her highly successful Eras tour. The song enjoyed renewed success, becoming Swift’s 10th song to top the Billboard Hot 100.\\nfolklore\\nfolklore\\nOn July 23, 2020, Swift announced on Instagram that she planned to release her eighth studio album, folklore. The 16-track album—made with Aaron Dessner of The National, Jack Antonoff of Bleachers, and Justin Vernon, better known as Bon Iver—debuted the next day at midnight. The alternative influence of her collaborators was apparent throughout.\\nFolklore produced the top 10 hits “The 1” and “Exile” featuring Bon Iver, plus went on to win Album of the Year at the 2021 Grammys. Swift also made history that year, becoming the only female solo artist to win that award three times.\\nevermore\\nevermore\\nLess than six months later, Swift dropped another surprise album to accompany folklore. She announced on December 10, 2020, that evermore would release at midnight the next day. “To put it plainly, we just couldn’t stop writing songs,” Swift wrote in a social media post. “In the past I’ve always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. There was something different with folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning.” Evermore earned a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year, though unlike its sister album, it didn’t win.\\nMidnights\\nMidnights\\nSwift released her 10th studio album, Midnights, at midnight on October 21, 2022. Three hours later, she released seven extra tracks in a deluxe version titled Midnights (3 am Edition). The album broke new ground for the already prolific Swift, making her the first artist to have a song on all of the top 10 slots on the Billboard Hot 100. That included “Anti-Hero” at No. 1, “Snow On The Beach” featuring Lana Del Rey, “Lavender Haze,” and “Karma.” Actor Zoë Kravitz earned writing credits on the latter two songs, and Jack Antonoff played a heavy hand in the album’s creation, cowriting 11 of Midnights’ 13 songs.\\nTaylor’s Version albums\\nTaylor’s Version albums\\nAfter the master recordings to her first six studio albums were sold in 2019, Swift decided to rerecord her old music to regain artistic and financial control of her catalog. So far, she has released four of six: Fearless (Taylor’s Version) in April 2021, Red (Taylor’s Version) in November 2021,\\xa0Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) in July 2023, and\\xa01989 (Taylor’s Version) in October 2023. Each included previously unreleased songs labeled as “From The Vault,” some of which she recorded with fellow musicians Keith Urban, Ed Sheeran, Chris Stapleton, and Phoebe Bridgers, among others.\\nSwift hasn’t shared when she will rerelease Taylor Swift and reputation.\\nWhat Is Taylor Swift’s Net Worth?\\nWhen she was 26, Swift was the highest-paid musician—and celebrity of any industry—of 2016 per Forbes, earning $170 million. It was one successful year among many, allowing the pop star to amass a huge net worth.\\nAs of December 13, 2023, Swift has a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to Forbes. Bloomberg first reported that Swift had become a billionaire in late October.\\nHer wealth has skyrocketed in the past year fueled by the pop star’s highly successful Eras Tour. Pollstar reported in December 2023 that the ongoing tour has earned $1,039,263,762 so far, making Swift the first musician to gross more than $1 billion on a single tour. The trade publication previously estimated the tour brings in $14 million in ticket sales each night.\\nSwift ranks No. 17 on Pollstar’s list of highest-grossing touring artists since 1980, having sold nearly $925 million in tickets from her first five tours and other appearances as of July 2022. The only women higher on the list are Madonna, Celine Dion, and Beyoncé.\\nContributing to her overall net worth are her real estate holdings. According to Business Insider, her properties total $84 million. She also has lucrative endorsement deals with Capitol One, Stella McCartney, Diet Coke, Apple, and more.\\nOver the years, the musician has shared some of her fortune to help others. For example, in 2013, she funded the $4 million Taylor Swift Education Center at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville. The facility opened with three classrooms, a learning lab, and a space dedicated to exhibits for children. In an interview with CMT Hot 20 Countdown, she explained that “music education is really such an important part of my life. My life changed so completely when I discovered writing my own songs and playing guitar, and that can’t necessarily all be taught to you in school because there aren’t enough hours in the day.”\\nSexual Assault Trial and Copyright Lawsuits\\nThe megastar has been involved in a few legal disputes, which all have gone in her favor. In August 2017, she testified in a trial against David Mueller, a former radio DJ she accused of groping her four years earlier. Mueller denied Swift’s allegations and said the incident cost him his job, which led him to sue Swift, her mother, and a radio station employee in 2015. Swift countersued him for alleged assault and battery, and a jury ruled in her favor in 2017, awarding her $1 in damages as a symbolic gesture.\\nSwift responded to the verdict in a statement: “I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society, and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this. My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.”\\nAlso in 2017, Swift was on the receiving end of a lawsuit, when two songwriters claimed that she stole the chorus of their song “Playas Gon’ Play” for her hit “Shake It Off.” Although a judge dismissed the case in early 2018, on the grounds that the “allegedly infringed lyrics are short phrases that lack the modicum of originality and creativity required for copyright protection,” an appeals court revived the suit in October 2019. Shortly before the trial was scheduled to begin, a judge dismissed the case in December 2022 at the request of both parties. A few media outlets reported there was a settlement, but if so, the terms weren’t publicly released.\\nThe musician was ensnared in another copyright lawsuit when a Mississippi woman claimed “a number of creative elements” from her self-published poetry book appeared in Swift’s companion book for her Lover (2019) album. The author sued in August 2022 but voluntarily dropped her case the next July.\\nScooter Braun Masters Controversy and Rerecording Project\\nIn November 2018, Swift signed with Universal Music Group’s Republic Records. The deal granted the musician ownership of her master recordings, something she didn’t have in her agreement with her first label, Big Machine Records.\\nThe next June, Swift revealed her dismay that Big Machine sold her catalog of music from her first six albums, up to reputation, to a company owned by Scooter Braun, manager of artists like Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande and a person she accused of bullying tactics. “Scooter has stripped me of my life’s work, that I wasn’t given an opportunity to buy,” she wrote on Tumblr. “Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it.” Just before the August 2019 release of Lover, Swift confirmed she would rerecord her old music to regain artistic and financial control of her catalog.\\nSwift’s catalog was sold once again, in October 2020, to Shamrock Holdings for around $300 million. In a lengthy post on Twitter (now called X), Swift gave her fans an update:\\nSwift added the deal still allows Braun to profit from her music and that she was in the process of rerecording her old music.\\nHer first rerecorded release, “Love Story (Taylor’s Version),” came at midnight on February 12, 2021. So far, she has reissued four of six albums from her early catalog.\\nWho Has Taylor Swift Dated?\\nCurrently, Swift is dating NFL football player Travis Kelce. On a July 2023 episode of his New Heights podcast, Kelce explained how he tried to give Swift his number on a friendship bracelet after attending the Eras Tour in Kansas City. Soon after, Swift reached out, and they went public with their romance in the fall. “Obviously, I’ve never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them... I’ve never dealt with it,” Kelce told The Wall Street Journal. “But at the same time, I’m not running away from any of it.”\\nSwift has attended six of his NFL games this season. “By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple,” she told Time.“I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.”\\nKelce returned the support in mid-November 2023, traveling to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to attend one of her concerts on the Eras Tour. During the show, Swift changed one of her lyrics in the song “Karma” to reference Kelce, and the couple were caught kissing on camera for the first time.\\nOver the years, Swift has dated several celebrities. During much of 2008, reports circulated that she was dating musician Joe Jonas of The Jonas Brothers. The song, “Forever & Always,” is reportedly about Jonas. The next year, Swift briefly dated actor Taylor Lautner, who she met while they filmed the 2010 movie Valentine’s Day. Swift then dated fellow singer-songwriter John Mayer for a brief period beginning in late 2009; he’s thought to be the inspiration for her song “Dear John.”\\nFrom there, Swift was romantically linked to actors Cory Monteith and Jake Gyllenhaal in 2010, then Conor Kennedy—son of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—in 2012. She celebrated the new year with One Direction’s Harry Styles in 2013, but the relationship ended later that year. In 2015, Swift dated DJ and music producer Calvin Harris, though the couple reportedly broke up in June 2016. Shortly thereafter, the pop star began dating actor Tom Hiddleston, but the couple split three months later.\\nSwift’s longest relationship to date was with actor Joe Alwyn. The pair met at the 2016 Met Gala and were together from 2017 until spring 2023. Beyond being another boyfriend to spark her songwriting, Alwyn also helped write songs on her folklore, evermore, and Midnights albums under the pseudonym William Bowery.\\nJust prior to the rumors about her and Kelce, Swift was said to be dating musician Matty Healy of The 1975 band.\\nFeud with Kanye West\\nBeyond her romantic relationships, Swift has had many high-profile friendships—with singer and actor Selena Gomez, model Karlie Kloss, and actor Blake Lively, to name a few—as well as headline-making feuds. Chief among those is her beef with rapper Kanye West.\\nIn 2009, when Swift won the MTV Video Music Award’s Best Female Video for “You Belong With Me,” West leaded to the stage as the young singer was giving her acceptance speech. He took the mic and famously declared, “Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’mma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!”\\nThe stunned Swift was unable to finish her acceptance speech, and West was removed from the show. When Beyoncé accepted her award for Best Video of the Year later in the night, she called Swift to the stage to finish her speech. West later apologized to Swift privately and made a public apology on The Jay Leno Show.\\nIn early 2016, West released his song “Famous” that includes a lyric taking credit for her fame and calling her a derogatory word. The rapper said Swift had approved the line in a phone call, though her team initially denied the conversation. Days later, Swift said in a Grammys acceptance speech:\\nKim Kardashian, who was married to West at the time, defended her husband in a GQ interview that summer and released clips of the phone call between the musicians. Although edited, the recordings proved Swift’s PR team had been lying in their initial statement. Kardashian also implied Swift was a snake in a July 2016 social media post. The pop star alluded to the fight in the songs “Look What You Made Me Do” and “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things” from her reputation (2017) album. She has also used snakes in music videos and onstage in concerts. The feud briefly reignited in March 2020 when a 25-minute video of the phone conversation leaked online.\\nDocumentary and Movies\\nPreviously having released several concert movies, Swift made a bigger splash with her Netflix documentary Miss Americana. The January 2020 release covered the makings of her recent studio albums as well as other high-profile events like her sexual assault trial. Miss Americana earned a limited run in theaters simultaneously to its streaming release.\\nSwift’s new concert movie, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, capitalizes on her massive star power. The film opened exclusively in theaters—3,850 locations in North America alone—in October 2023. According to Comscore, no other concert movie has enjoyed as wide of a release. It also has showtimes in some 90 other countries and has grossed nearly $250 million worldwide as of December 5, 2023, making it the highest-grossing concert film of all time. An extended version, with three additional songs, is now available to rent on streaming services.\\nSwift has also dabbled in acting. She appeared in the 2010 blockbuster Valentine’s Day, alongside Julia Roberts, Jamie Foxx, Jessica Biel, Bradley Cooper, and other Hollywood heavyweights. A voice role in The Lorax (2012) and another role in The Giver (2014) followed. In December 2019, Swift was featured in a live-action adaptation of the famed Broadway musical Cats, along with Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, and Rebel Wilson. She also teamed with Cats creator Andrew Lloyd Webber to write a song, “Beautiful Ghosts,” for the movie. Swift also had a cameo in 2022’s Amsterdam.\\nQuotes\\nThe Biography.com staff is a team of people-obsessed and news-hungry editors with decades of collective experience.

       "\"# OpenAI's Recent Drama\\n\\nOpenAI, a prominent player in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, has recently been embroiled in a dramatic series of events involving the firing and subsequent reinstatement of its CEO, Sam Altman. The unfolding crisis has sent shockwaves through the tech community and raised questions about the company's governance, strategic direction, and the potential impact on the development of AI technologies.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nOpenAI, founded in 2015, initially positioned itself as a non-profit research lab with a mission to develop AI tools for the benefit of humanity, free from financial obligations. However, the company's recent actions have raised concerns about its adherence to these founding principles.\\n\\n## The Crisis Unfolds\\n\\nThe crisis at OpenAI began with the abrupt firing of CEO Sam Altman by the company's board of directors. The board cited Altman's alleged lack of candor in his communications with them as the reason for his dismissal. This move, which took place on November 17, 2023, sent shockwaves through the tech industry and raised questions about the company's internal dynamics and decision-making processes.\\n\\nThe firing of Altman was reportedly linked to a disagreement between him and OpenAI's chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, regarding the company's strategic direction. Altman's purported push for aggressive development of AI technologies clashed with the board's desire for a more cautious approach, leading to a significant rift within the organization.\\n\\n## Reinstatement and Ongoing Developments\\n\\nIn a surprising turn of events, just days after his dismissal, reports emerged that the board was reconsidering its decision and was in discussions with Altman about his potential return to the company. This unexpected development has added further complexity to the situation and raised questions about the stability and leadership of OpenAI.\\n\\n## Impact on the AI Industry\\n\\nThe turmoil at OpenAI has not gone unnoticed within the AI industry. The company's high-profile status and its pivotal role in AI research and development have made its internal struggles a matter of significant interest and concern for industry stakeholders, investors, and the broader tech community.\\n\\n## Future Implications\\n\\nThe ongoing drama at OpenAI has the potential to have far-reaching implications for the company's future trajectory, its relationships with strategic partners such as Microsoft, and its ability to attract and retain top talent in the competitive AI landscape. The outcome of the crisis and the decisions made by the company's leadership in the coming months will likely shape the company's standing and influence in the AI industry.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe crisis at OpenAI involving the firing and potential reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman has brought to light the complexities and challenges inherent in navigating the intersection of technology, governance, and ethical considerations in the AI industry. The company's actions and decisions in the aftermath of this crisis will be closely watched and are likely to have a lasting impact on the company's reputation and its role in shaping the future of AI.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the events at OpenAI underscore the delicate balance between technological advancement and ethical responsibility in the development and deployment of AI technologies. The company's ability to navigate these challenges and emerge with a clear strategic direction will be closely monitored by industry observers and stakeholders.\\n\\nReferences:\\n- The Guardian.
